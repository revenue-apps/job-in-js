// Stagehand Integration Rules (JS Only)

// 🚫 Do not use TypeScript
- All API integration code must be written in plain JavaScript.

// 🌐 API Usage
- Stagehand endpoint must be set via environment variable (`STAGEHAND_API_URL`).
- API calls must use `fetch` with a timeout of 10 seconds.
- Wrap all fetch calls in try/catch with detailed error messages.

// 📋 Job Scraping
- Always send clean and minimal job URLs to Stagehand.
- Expect and handle JSON response: must contain `title`, `company`, `location`, `description`, `url`.

// ⚠️ Error Handling
- Log errors as `[Stagehand Error] <job_url> — <error_message>`.
- If DNS/timeout error, retry once with exponential backoff.
- Do not allow Stagehand failures to block the overall scraping pipeline.

// 🧪 Dev & Test
- Never call Stagehand in dev/test without an explicit mock.
- Provide at least 2 mock job HTML files to simulate Stagehand input.
