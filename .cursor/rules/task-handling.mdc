// ✅ TASK EXECUTION — DOs

- Always read the full task description twice before starting.
- Ask clarifying questions if anything is vague or open-ended.
- Break the task into smaller subtasks or checkpoints before implementation.
- Create a quick plan or list of intended changes if it's non-trivial.
- Commit early with meaningful messages once a section is complete.
- Communicate delays or blockers early to teammates.
- Test your changes manually and/or write minimal test code where needed.
- Clean up unused code or temporary logs before submitting.
- Leave TODO comments only if absolutely required, and explain why.

// ❌ TASK EXECUTION — DON'Ts

- Don't assume missing details — clarify before implementing.
- Don’t edit unrelated parts of the code unless explicitly required.
- Don’t leave console.log or debug prints in committed code.
- Don’t push directly to main branches without review (unless hotfix).
- Don’t submit work without testing or checking for regressions.
- Don’t ignore lint or formatting issues — run the formatter before commit.
- Don’t rewrite large sections without clear reason or discussion.
